			<h1>Equilibrium Balance Mod Changelog</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the changelog for the Equilibrium balance mod. The purpose of this mod is to fix the existing issues with the game, and make improvements to gameplay by increasing its strategic diversity, while keeping the overall feel of the game the same and familiar, <b>so you don't need to relearn the game to play this mod.</b>

			<p>You don't need to read the whole changelog to be able to play, you can do exactly what you always do and it will work. Perhaps some of the things are not so strong as before but you can still pick all the usual strategies and be successful with them.

			<p>I put a lot of time and effort to bring you this mod, I hope you enjoy it as much as everyone else who has played it so far. 

			<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions or complaints I will be happy to listen to you. However please back up your opinions of balance with replay evidence first.

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/ff/Cybran_Wall.png"> Quick Summary</h3>
			There are many changes in this mod, but don't worry, you need to remember only a few of them! The rest are designed to bring improvements while not compromising your gameplay.
			<ul>
			<li> Air factories cost more energy, but air is cheaper. Build 1-2 extra pgens before building an air factory!
			<li> Mercies deal damage over time! Moving targets receive only a fraction of the damage.
			<li> Mass storages are cheaper, provide less mass, and explode on death! Consider safety and use adjacency.
			<li> Energy storages, provide much more adjacency bonus, use them for fix your energy problem.
			<li> RAS energy income has been nerfed, don't reclaim your pgens afterwards!
			<li> T4 units take much longer to build. Get t2/3 engineers, they are more efficient in this mod.
			<li> Veterancy doesn't instant-heal units anymore, dont rely on that when attacking with experimentals or your ACU.
			</ul>

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/c/cf/Upgrade_Icon.png">Veterancy</h3>
			This is the first major change of the mod, which fixes many issues with veterancy and also allows it to become a larger part of the game rather than being mostly irrelevant for everything except T4 units and ACUs.
			<p> Here are the rules the new veterancy system as follows:
			<ul>
			<li>Units receive veterancy points that are equal to the destroyed unit's mass cost.
			<li>Units are promoted to next veterancy level, when they have 100% of their own mass cost in veterancy points
			<li>Destroying a unit with veterancy gives 20% more veterancy for each level - killing a tank with 1 star: 120% of its mass cost, killing a tank with 5 stars: 200% of its mass cost is awarded.
			<li>If multiple units kill the same target, the veterancy is shared out between them according to the fraction of the damage they dealt.
			<p>
			<li>After promotion units receive new max health and gain higher regeneration, but don't heal for that value.
			<li>T1/T2/sACU units gain 20% more max hp.
			<li>T3/ACU units gain 15% more max hp.
			<li>Experimentals gain 10% more max HP.
			<p>
			<li>All units gain increased regeneration depending on which category they are in:
			<li>Main Combat Units → The regen they get increases with each level
			<li>Raider/Support Units → The rise in regen is linear.
			</ul>
			<p>
			<p>
			Regeneration values for Main Combat Units:
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +1+2+3+4+5 => 1/3/6/10/15
			<li> T2: +2+4+6+8+10 => 2/6/12/20/30
			<li> T3: +3+6+9+12+15 => 3/9/18/30/45
			<li> SACUs: +4+8+12+24+36 => 4/12/24/40/60
			<li> T4: +12+24+36+48+60 => 12/36/72/120/180
			<p>
			<li> ACU (Special Case): 5+5+5+5+5 =>(10+) 5/10/15/20/25
			</ul>
			<p>
			Raider/Support Units:
			<ul>
			<li> T1:+2+2+2+2+2 => 2/4/6/8/10
			<li> T2:+4+4+4+4+4 => 4/8/12/16/20
			<li> T3:+6+6+6+6+6 => 6/12/18/24/30
			</ul>
			<p>
			Ships (Main Combat):
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +2+4+6+8+10 => 2/6/12/20/30
			<li> T2: +4+8+12+16+20 => 4/12/24/40/60
			<li> T3: +12+24+36+48+60 => 12/36/72/120/180
			</ul>
			<p>
			Submarines (Raider/Support):
			<ul>
			<li> T1: +4+4+4+4+4 => 4/8/12/16/20
			<li> T2: +6+6+6+6+6 => 6/12/18/24/30
			<li> T3: +12+12+12+12+12 => 12/24/36/48/60
			</ul>
			<p>
			
			Main Combat Units are: Buildings, T1/2/3 tanks(not fast), Artillery, Mobile AA, AA air, T2F/B, Gunships, Ships
			<p>
			Raider units are: Land scouts, LABs, T2 hover tanks, T2 range bots, T3 raid bots, T3 snipers, Bombers, Transports, Submarines
			<p>
			ACUs/Experimentals only need to destroy 50% of their own cost in mass worth of enemy units.
			<p>
			ACUs mass cost 2000m => 1000m required for vet = ~20T1 units to get veterancy but for destroying an ACU units gain 2000xp
			
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>To avoid situations when destroying a T3 scout (195m) is worth the same as destroying a T3 battleship (9000m)
			<li>To add a system which is fair and predictable for each unit (units need to destroy 100% of their own mass to vet up)
			<li>You should no longer be required to self destruct lower tech units to prevent the enemy from gaining ridiculous amounts of experience
			<li>To fill new max hp faster and make units with veterancy more important overall. T3/4 units have less HP gains to promote using lower tech units against higher tech ones. Experimentals vet up faster but don't gain as much from doing so.
			<li>Splitting veterancy rewards ensures that units gain vet much more evenly rather than having one 5 vet loyalist after an exp battle.
			<li>The regeneration helps different units gain the most from veterancy values - units which won't live long get regen faster than units which do, helping to highlight their roles and making them more varied.
			<li>Naval units and submarines are far more expensive than land units and have more HP so they also gain more regeneration.  
			</ul>

		<div id="reclaim" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/f/f5/Cybran_T1_Engineer.png"> Reclaim</h3>
			1. The time needed to reclaim something is 2x longer.
			<ul>			
			<li> A unit with a build rate of 1 reclaims at: <strike>10m/s</strike> → 5m/s 
			</ul>
            <p>
			2. The sACU wreck is reclaimable 2x slower than other units.
            <p>
            3. Megalith’s egg reclaim abuse <strike>1800m/s</strike> → 200m/s 
            <p>
            4. Air experimental units wrecks gain <strike>81% mass</strike> → 40.5% mass 
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
            <ol>
			<li>To make it harder to secure a reclaim field after a fight, meaning that the map becomes more dynamic as there are reclaim fields to fight over for longer.</ul>
			<li>Taking more time to be reclaimed, sACU spam will no longer instantly be converted into mass as soon as one of them dies.
            <li>To prevent situation where megalith immediately reclaim experimental from battle field. 
            <li>Air experimentals leave half of their mass in wrecks now - this is because they are likely to die quickly and this decreases the amount of mass delivery. Its similar reason as on ASF - be more free to use them on enemy territory.
            </ol>

		<div id="factories" class="card">
			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/7/77/Cybran_T1_Land_Factory.png">Factories</h3>
			1.Units of the same tech level now drain resources at similar rates, a higher tech factory building lower tech units drains the same amount, but builds units faster.
			<ul>
			<li>Factory type - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3
			<li>Land: 5m/25e - 10m/50e - 20m/200e
			<li> Air: 3m/50e - 7m/150e - 20m/1000e
			<li> Navy: 5m/50e - 15m/100e - 45m/450e
			</ul>
			2.Building/upgrading a factory has the same drain as building units inside the upgraded factory:
			<ul>
			<li>Factory type - 	T1 - 	T2 - 	T3
			<li>Land: 300m 1500e 300bt - 900m 4500e 2250bt - 3600m  36000e 9000bt
			<li>Air: 210m 3500e 350bt - 630m 4500e  1800bt  - 3600m 120000e 9600bt
			<li>Naval:300m 3000e 300bt  - 1350m 4500e 1800bt - 3600m 36000e 9000bt
			<p>
			3.The same rule applies to slave factory upgrades
			<li>T2/3 slave factories are built 3 times faster than HQs
			</ul>
			
			4.Factory build rates:
			<ul>
			<li>Land: <strike>20/40/90</strike> → 25/50/100 
			<li>Air: <strike>20/40/120</strike> → 20/40/120 
			<li>Navy: <strike>20/60/120</strike> → 20/60/180 
			<li>Quantum gateway: <strike>120</strike> → 100
			</ul>
			
			5.Build time of experimentals:
			<ul>
			<li>T4 <b>land</b> units build <b>3</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			<li>T4 <b>air</b> units build <b>4.8</b> times faster than equivalent mass in a T3 factory
			</ul>
			
			6.T3 HQ factory hp for all factions:
			<ul>
			<li>Land/Air: 20000hp
			<li>Naval: 37500hp
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>To be able to more easily predict resource consumption of factories
			<li>Slave factories are built faster, and are cheaper, so you need fewer engineers in game, and support more aggressive gameplay
			<li>Speed up the game slightly
			<li>Engineers slightly nerfed as a result
			<li>Make experimentals slower to build, (and remove situations when a megalith is built in the same time as 3 bricks) Air is built faster than land because it's more expensive and needs to be built faster so they are still useable and convenient to build, without needing huge hordes of engies. 
			<li>To be fair to every faction and to make factories die when they’re linked with 4 T3 mass fabs.
			</ol>

			3.ACU build rates
			<ul>
			<li>T2: <strike>42</strike> → 40 
			<li>T3: <strike>126</strike> → 120 
			<li>sACU build rate: <strike>56</strike> → 25 ; Engineering Upgrade: <strike>98</strike> → 100br 
			</ul>
			4.Sacrifice system:
			<ul>
			<li>T1/T2 Aeon engineers: <strike>60</strike> → 80% mass value <strike>60</strike> → 320% energy value
			<li>T3 engineers: 80% mass value 160% energy value
			<li>sACUs: <strike>90</strike> → 80% mass value and <strike>90</strike> → 80% energy value 
			</ul>
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Making buildpower easier to estimate. And removing the imbalance where Aeon/Seraphim T3 engineers get more build power for the same mass cost. (it was supposed to “compensate” for lack of hives)
			<li>Cybran engineering stations are 10% less efficient than engineers = fewer engineers in game, and more use of hives. Kennels are 30% less efficient than engineers, but can fly. Br on buildings was adjusted to drain more predictable numbers. Drone is cheaper because 250m is too much, given how easy it is to destroy drones.
			<li>sACU build rates decreased to help separate combat presets from eco and field engineer ones, so you can have more choice with the different sACUs. Also helps prevent them reclaiming their own wrecks instantly after/during combat.
			<li>To make the sacrifice system useful: since engineers cost 5x more energy than mass, and most buildings cost 15x more energy than mass, which means that engineers waste more mass than usual since the mass/e ratio is different. For T3 engineers it’s a smaller increase, because they cost 10x more energy than mass, for sACUs it’s the same, because they cost 30x more energy than mass.

			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Make energy storages more important, and to separate the good players from the excellent ones.
			<li>Make turtling and ecoing more risky, reward aggressive gameplay, bring a fairer choice between using factory or storage adjacency, nerf the T3 mex so when it’s next to 4 storages it dies to one TML and leaves 100% of its wreck value. Adjacency bonus decreased so you don't have to put storages next to mexes, but still can.  HP and price decreased to make the storage better for storage purposes, not just eco.
			<li>Mex Changes:
			<ul>
			<li>T1 mexes are cheaper, promotes aggressive mex building, in turn promoting having engineers at the front, in turn promoting aggressive reclaiming. In short, gives a lot of good habits for noobs to follow, while also reducing the crippling mass stall that noobs can get at the start of the game. Also balances out the additional aggressiveness from the game and creates a better choice between choosing to build mexes and reclaiming mass.
			<li>T2 mexes cost less mass to get players faster onto T2 eco, where the game becomes more interesting.
			<li>T3 mexes that are cheaper, but less effective especially with combination with less effective storages, this is a nerf to T3 eco, to smoothen the transition between T2/3 mexes. More hp to compensate for other changes and to help protect your mexes.
			</ul>
			<li>To make mass fabricators a more viable option: Their efficiency is the same, but they live longer, and need less power to support them. With storages they have similar efficiency to T3 mexes without storages.
			<li>Fixed the way that you don't need energy storage for economic reasons. The adjacency bonus means that for 3200m in you get 2500e with a T3 pgen, or 2500e and 60 000e storage with 16 storages around a T3 Pgen. Or 600m in storage between 2x T2 Pgen is also +250e bonus.
			<li>To have more consistent numbers, less hp so it gets destroyed with 16 T2 fabs next to it, less explosion damage to prevent chain reactions with multiple T3 Pgens
			<li>Make power generators more important (power snipes), and simply make it less OP. This also helps stop strat rushes and having no choice over whether to get this upgrade when ecoing.

			</ul>
 			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>To make the ACU eventually repairable 
			<li>To nerf gun to keep it in line with the other changes and keep ranges consistent throughout the mod.
                <ul>
                <li>The turret turn rate helps with microing the acu when it switches targets - makes it nicer to use.
                </ul>
			<li>To make T2/3 units stronger against ACUs
			<li>To make Cybran acu more consistent with the others
			<li>Making T2 more useful for building, and less for fighting, for fighting there is a different upgrade, Aeon and Cybran have more because they can't have range/gun + T2, 
			<li>Price changed for to give a constant drain of 10m/s 200e/s, less hp for reason that hp gain from veteracy multiply and then cause problem with sera nano that will survive nuke. 
			<li>Drains 20m/500e, making it much easier to get without ruining eco or pausing.
			<li>More consistent drain values when upgrading
			<li>Making it harder to kill an enemy ACUs at close ranges with ACU TML, acu tml doesn't destroy tmd
			<li>Aeon upgrades: 
				<ul>
				<li>Chrono: lowered price and effectiveness, making it a safer, more consistent upgrade, hoping that it will be seen more in game, because it’s an interesting option that is underused. 
				</ul>
			<li>UEF upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Nano: for more survivability
				<li>Shield: compared to Aeon, it costs less mass but more energy
				<li>Billy: making it a more consistent weapon, where it's easier to defend against, but it's more dangerous against land units
				</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Gun: Because the acu lacks hp when compared to other factions
				<li>Laser: For more fluent numbers
				<li>Torpedo upgrade: To nerf Cybran early T2 navy where it's hard to counter torp acu
				<li>Cloak: making it cheaper so it can be used more often, because it’s an interesting part of the game
				</ul>
			
			<li>Sera upgrades:
				<ul>
				<li>Regen field: It's hard to compare to gun, so now its a choice between having a stronger acu, or a stronger army. more hp and regen to allow the acu to stay in fights longer. Reducing max regeneration on advanced restoration field is for a reason: to prevent abuse. BTW: did you know that a single full vet Sera destroyer (surfaced) with an ACU with resto field can quite easily beat a battleship? 
				<li>Heavy gun: To make it used more often in game, because it’s too expensive for normal use.
				</ul>

		<h2>Land</h2>
		
        In this mod land units are adjusted to keep the same purposes but to make gameplay more consistent (less random BS) and make tech level progression not so steep - so you can use lower tech units more effectively later on, rather than having to crtl-k them for mass.
            
            <ul>
			<li>T1 units have more hp, and less dps, in total with the same efficiency, but give more time while they are being killed = can be used as a meat shield for higher tech armies that have a larger range
			<li>T2 units have more concentrated dps in one unit, and have units with special roles
			<li>T3 units have even more concentrated dps and hp in one unit than T2, and have additional units for special roles.
			<li>T4 experimentals have a new build-time, which is 33% of their mass spent on units built from a T3 factory, before was experimental build-time was equal to ~12%.
			</ul>

			<li>Striker: <strike>56m 24dps 3,4sp</strike> → 60m 400hp 24dps 3,4sp
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Making labs usable not only at the start of the game, more speed to be better for raiding; they have had a huge buff, but don’t worry they still lose to tanks in direct combat in larger numbers! However you can now use them with a T1/2 army as well.
				<ul>
				<li>Changed target priorities to something more logical: where you kill radar first, and then ACU for easier ghetto snipes.
				<li>Selen: more maneuverability to be more like a lab and less like a scout, same reason for firing from transport where Seraphim was missing this feature.
				<li>Flare: Capture for possible capture mex instead of destroying. So you can use labs for things other than just raiding for the first 5 minutes. 
				<li>Mech marine: strongest lab, but without any abilities.
				</ul>
			<li>To be able to chase bombers better, and be worth building in the first place, now it can also hit interceptors. 
				<ul>
				<li>The Cybran MAA is also usable like a weaker aurora, with the same range. Homing projectile, because look awesome and whiteout it miss most of shot on long range. Have more AA range because other AA are faster.
				<li>To make it easier to use since you don't need to remember which units are toggled, they auto toggle now.
                <li>Its small feature, same as repair on mantis, its nearly useless but maybe sometime can be creative use.  
				</ul>
			<li>T1 Mobile artillery: mostly unchanged, but it needed some adjustments to fit in with the balance and got some quality-of-life changes.
				<ul>
				<li>Medusa: Stun added against T3 units, dps added to make it less annoying to use vs pd, so price is also increased.
				<li>Fervor: Compensating for the aurora losing range, their main advantage on T1, the fervor was made better for use against land units (and acu). 
				<li>Lobo: vision time increased for constant visibility while firing. and give this feature more potential. AOE increased to help it compete with other artillery.
				</ul>
			<li>T1 now tanks live longer, so take a longer time to defend against push. Also can be a better meat shield for higher tech units, so they are more useful in late game.
				<ul>
				<li>Speed decreased to let LABs have more room for raiding.
				<li>Mantis now have a tank icon so you can separate them from labs, which are now usable in your main army. More build rate so the assist feature is used more often, less dps, but better damage per shot. It’s mainly a nerf for Cybran, where they have additional damage from MAA, basically for free now.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>To have consistent and predictable drain values.
			<li>AA flak: To make gunships a more useful option, the hover ability is now more expensive. Faction with t2 shield have less hp on flak. Target priority changed to reduce annoying behavior, less range, and more muzzle velocity to make them be more reliable.
			<li>Evensongs were very weak against tmd, so they now have a nicer reload time and less dps to keep it balanced.
			<li>Hover units are better on land, but worse against navy, so they are now a relevant strategic option on land and while not as OP on navy.
			<li>Hoplite slowed down, because hover units are also slower.
			<li>Sparky is now a stronger unit that can compete better during the T3 stage.
			<li>Mongeese don’t miss, making them a very deadly unit, so I decided on a conceptual change to a new unit type, which is in between hoplites and pillars. It adds a  new strategic option that is different than simply using hoplites, and increases faction diversity.
			<li>Rhino turret turn rate increased to make them more consistent when being microed.
			<li>Riptide is made useable on land, has more build time so its harder to spam, what make him less effective against navy.
			<li>Obsidians with changed target priority are now less vulnerable to OC, because you can spread them and still focus the ACU.
			<li>Fire beetles are more effective against land armies and worse for sniping ACUs, stealth can be combined with deceivers for a potentially deadly weapon. Use with cloaked moles to confuse the enemy!

			What I tried to achieve with T3 balance is to have a T3 tech which doesn't make T2 units obsolete, but does give an advantage. Currently T1/2 units very quickly become useless as soon as the T3 level is reached, which I think is quite sad since T2 has all the support units that should be used with t3, instead of just brick spam.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Shields are buildable from naval factories, to make them a more convenient option when focusing on naval production.
            <li>Absolvers have been adjusted to make them nicer to use:
                <ul>
                <li>To be able to outrange ravagers under shields more comfortably.
                <li>Buildable from naval factories, to make them a more convenient option.
                <li>Price adjusted to fit the 520m price category.
                </ul>
            <li>Spearheads fit 440m the category, and have more aoe make them slightly better against units.
			<li>Titans and loyalist adjusted a little to make (and keep) them useful.
                <ul>
                <li>Titans are stronger.

                <ul>
                <li>Othuums now needs micro to win against Harbingers. Also they got their much needed buff.

			<h3><img src="http://wiki.faforever.com/images/d/d1/Cybran_T4_Monkey_Bot.png">T4 Land Units</h3>
            Experimentals in this game were not in the right spot - they were more of a cheese unit than a true experimental. Their incredibly fast build time leads to teams rushing a monkey and the difference between a victory and a mass donation relying on whether the opponent scouts you 10 seconds later, which is not a consistent way of winning the game. Because of this the experimentals are very weak in direct, fair combat. I increased their buildtime and make them less cheese and more strategic instead.
            
            <p>
			Experimentals have roughly 15% less hp than before
            <p>
            The GC, Monkeylord, Megalith, Ythotha and the Fatboy now prioritise the ACU over everything else.

			<ul>
			<li>Megalith egg build times adjusted to the Megalith’s new build rate and units are built 2x faster than in a regular T3 factory.
			</ul>
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>T3 units are weaker in this mod (-25%dps -35%hp), so experimentals are changed to maintain balance.
			<li>Price increased because Ion storm is now extremely useful for supporting your army.
			<li>DPS moved  from long range to short, because T3 units have less hp, and dps, short range is less annoying and gives more time for opponents to deal with the fatboy.
			<li>Scathis was a very cheap game ender on small maps, and useless on larger ones.
				<ul>
				<li>Reworked to be more like experimental mobile artillery, and less like a game ender.
				<li>EMP is for supporting allied armies, and to disrupt the enemy.

            Previously OP, the sACUs have recieved much needed rebalanced in my mod. Here extra care was taken to ensure that all the presets can be used in various situations, and even sACUs without presets. In general sACUs have a more supporting role and work well when mixed in with T3 units.

			</ul>
			
			
			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Price and range reduced to make sACUs weaker without any upgrades, but worth building like presets, opening a new role for sACUs. 
			<li>With reduced buildpower and more time to be reclaimed sACU there is less chance that sACU spam will reclaim anything that dies immediately after the battle.
			<li>The death explosions make sACU spam more risky since it could start a chain reaction, also it’s possible to use as a kamikaze weapon. Damage type changed to prevent teleportation snipes of important buildings by dieing next to them. 
			
			<li>Aeon:
            <ul>
			<li>Sacrifice removed: because it was a useless upgrade, and it’s much better to have nano in it’s place so you have a military upgrade on each slot. Now sacrifice is part of the rapid fabricator.
			</ul>
			
			<li>UEF:
            <ul>
			<li>Jamming is cheaper, because it’s not used often and it buffs pure support sACUs. 
			<li>Gun: nerfed because it was OP.
			<li>Bubble shields are cheaper and  have better regeneration to increase the use of pure support sACUs.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Cybran:
            <ul>
			<li>Lots of hp and lack of dps: to increase faction diversity, and for AA/EMP that will be stronger without any extra upgrades.
			<li>Stealth: changed to a stealth field, to encourage use as a support sACU.
			<li>EMP: Stun changed to be less op against T3 units.
			<li>Nano: regeneration decreased because T3 units have less dps.
			<li>Cloak: buffed so it's used more often.
			</ul>
			
			<li>Sera:
            <ul>
			<li>Decreased passive resource generation to make them like the other factions, it was a big buff, and Sera sACUs are already the best fighters so they don’t need another advantage for free. 
			<li>Swapped the positions of the rapid fabricator with teleport so you can have combat engineer sACUs.
			<li>TML is more expensive but has more aoe, and more importantly can store up to 3 missiles which can annihilate an incoming army from huge ranges.
			<li>Overchange: less dps and rof so it's not as OP, more aoe so it's better against units when it fires, range bonus so you don't need to have sensor upgrade for it to be effective, because the default range is 23.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Price changed to standardise the factory drain values and to help promote scouting.
            <li>Less energy cost and more mass cost to make tech switching is easier and to encourage each player in a team game to build some air. The speed increase helps catch strats.
            <li>Buffed bombers, to make them easier to use, since they make the game more interesting and to keep them in line since MAA is buffed in this mod.  Have faster circle so is no reason to hover-bomb.
                <ul>
                <li>Removed friendly fire to avoid situations where multiple bombers kill themselves with their own bombs.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                <li>Aeon: Increasing faction diversity, the Aeon bomber is better for single targets, and higher tech units; the emp can also support your army, but it’s less useful for armies, unlike Sera with its large aoe.
                </ul>
            <li>First jester is not an issue, so it can be of a similar mass efficiency to T2 gunships, also the buff helps maintain its effectiveness since T1/2 MAA has been buffed here.
            <li>Transports are underused and make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting, so I tried to encourage transport usage. Speed increased since interceptors have more speed, and they can drop into more dangerous territory now.
                <ul>
                <li>Aeon transport capture ability for more faction diversity, and add a potentially interesting tool and new tactics.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
			<li>Increased the faction diversity with gunships:
                <ul>
                <li>Spectres are faster because Aeon doesn't have a T2 bomber,
                <li>Renegades have  more range because they can't move while firing effectively
                <li>Vulthoos are stronger because Seraphim doesn't have T3 gunships 
                </ul>
			<li>Torpedo Bombers are slightly better with a bit more speed, and I added small a omni radius to make it possible for them to see submarines which now have sonar stealth.
			<li>T2 air needed to be better against T3 air, so T2fighter/bombers cost less, have less ground damage and health, but AA dps is unchanged. Also the Notha firing tolerance changed so it doesn't miss as much. 
                <ul>
                <li>Target priorities to make using them less frustrating
                <li>Corsair AA was buffed to be more similar to other T2 bombers (still much worse)
                <li>Swift winds receive more hp to maintain their advantage as the best T2 AA fighter.
                </ul>
			<li>Mercies have been reworked to be better against sniping buildings, and worse for ACU snipes - an ACU moving away will receive only ~30% of the full damage. Crash damage was increased so that the mercy is only 99% useless if it gets shot down and because it makes more sense for a flying bomb to deal some damage on falling.
			<li>Transports got some regeneration to make them reusable without needing to pay attention to repair them, more speed because interceptors are also faster.

			<h4>Purpose:</h4>

			<li>Increased faction diversity between Spy planes:
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran added stealth toggle, and energy consumption, so it's in line with the other stealthed aircraft.
                <li>Sera doesn’t have any advanced intel like the other factions ( eye of rihane, Soothsayer, novax) so you can place it in the enemy base similar to Selens.
                </ul>
            <li>ASF were just unbelievably OP. Their price was increased to allow more time for T2 units, before the inevitable ASF swarm arrives. They have less speed, more reload time, less dps to make them less superior (brutally unstoppable with air) and allow T2 air to compete (but still lose), more turret yaw/pitch range to give less random results in air combat (this is the cone where asf can fire).
            <li>T3 gunships are a very interesting but underused unit so they got cheaper, with the same effectiveness so you can build them more often (also buffed a bit).
                <ul>
                <li>Cybran got stealth instead of jamming so you can have fully stealthed T3 air, and because it’s a Cybran trait
                <li>UEF got jamming because it’s more of a UEF trait
                <li>Aeon restorer is adjusted slightly so it’s the same as before relative to changed air.
                </ul>
            <li>Continental: Less e consumption and less AA dps  - better than making it stupidly expensive. Its shield bubble is also slightly bigger so it can be combined with T3 gunships and cover them
            <li>Strats were a bit of a cheese unit so they have less speed and hp so they can be countered with T1/2 air, dmg correction to make them more systematic, more reload time so they doesn’t destroy mexes too well while hover bombing.

            <li>Wreck: air experimental are likely to fall down pretty fast and then are jast huge mass donation, reason for half mass wreck value is same as for asf.
			<li>Soul Ripper: decreased its mass cost, because it's not much stronger than a GC -  when instant heal doesn't exist air exps are weaker (and are less cheese). More crash damage, because it's a very big unit.  
			<li>Ahwasa: speed reduced so it's easier to catch up to.
			<li>CZAR: It was a useless unit, that could help only due to its massive crash damage. But the CZAR is an experimental fortress, not a mercy. Massive hp increase and AA effectiveness was given so it could be at least a little useful against air, and less against land. Now a CZAR can destroy 50-75% of its own mass in asf. The beam damage was changed to be more effective against buildings, and less against moving land units, and depth charge dps was increased so that they’re not absolutely useless. The CZARs speed was reduced to make it less about cheese and more about strategy, and also helping ground AA counter it (20-25% mass in land AA destroys a CZAR)

            Navy had the best tech level balance in FAF, but there are still some things which could be ironed out - mostly quality of life changes. Also several non-naval units were introduced to the naval game to make it more refreshing and diverse (such as wagners having a bit of torpedo damage now, and mobile shields).
            <p>
            However submarines in the naval game are a little underused, and I shifted things around to make them more useful and interesting.
            <p>
            As a whole, surface warfare is largely unchanged, but submarines should be seen more often, as well as other support units.

            <li>All Submarines have sonar stealth, and all naval units (except frigates and cruisers) have low underwater vision, and don't see submarines when they are microed.

			<li>The Shard now has more hp, so it doesn't get killed in one pass by torpedo bombers.
			<li>The Beacon has more range than others but less speed, so it needs micro to be more effective than other frigates.
			<li>Submarines get sonar stealth to give them an intel advantage against destroyers. 
                <ul>
                <li>Less range on deck cannon because it was bigger as frigate range what is weird. 
                <li>The Aeon submarine is faster because it doesn’t have a deck gun, which can be a huge disadvantage.

			<li>Mermaid: These boats provide a huge bonus and the price increase will balance that, as well as the crazy anti-torp stacking htey have, regen added because it can’t get veterancy.
			<li>Bulwark: Price changed to standardise factory drain values, regen added because it can’t get veterancy, less aoe on its shield to make it less OP, so you need more bulwarks to completely cover your navy (its one of the main reasons why UEF navy is OP).
			<li>Cooper: Nerfed so it's not better against destroyers than a destroyer (when microed).
			<li>Sonar: Stealth added to give an intel advantage against destroyers and be able to win with good micro.
			<li>Cruisers got their price changed to standardise factory drain values.
                <ul>
                <li>Infinity Class: Tiny buff to its tiny ground weapon to help balance it with other cruisers that have missiles and also direct fire weapons.
                <li>Siren Class: Toggle on its AA removed to reduce use of a very annoying and poorly implemented function where players can’t tell if its switched to focus air or land. Now it can switch freely by itself.
                <li>The seraphim cruiser got a quality of life change to its flak weapon - more muzzle velocity, less dps to make it more consistent and nice to use.
                </ul>
            <li>Destroyers got their water vision reduced as part of the method of making submarines better, with more aoe and muzzle velocity to be able to hit small land units, which were nearly immune to destroyers; added torpedo dmg only against submarines, to increase the difference between catching submarines at close range, while microed submarines can win.
                <ul>
                <li>Exodus: Damage changed to roughly 1000, aoe increased to cover for the lack of a T2 land bombardment unit for Aeon, while keeping navy balance the same.

                <ul>
                <li>Strategic submarines are cheaper because they are underused and make the game more fun. Plan_B reworked to increase faction diversity and to make it usable against navy, it’s not as good as Sera sub hunters, but it can compete.

            <li>Galaxy has more range so it’s less crap
			<li>UEF has less hp, to increase consistency and to make it less strong. 
			<li>Summit has less dps and muzzle velocity to make them more balanced against non-UEF navy.
			<li>Atlantis is faster so it’s not some sort of sea snail, regen added because every exp has natural regen.
			<li>Tempest: build time increased by a lot (4x), reworked into a real experimental unit - it still loses against equal mass in battleships/subs but now it has a reason to be built, which isn't only stupidly fast build time.

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>T1pd: Its too strong against non-artilery army comparing with T2 pd.
			<li>T2pd: Adjusted and standardised the prices and build times so they work with all the land changes.
			<li>T3pd: Nerfed to maintain balance with the nerfed T3 units. 
			<li>T2 Static Artillery: This unit was nearly useless due to its firing randomness and cost, it was only worth building them against fatboys and in some cases Cybran T2 navy. In this mod they are reworked to be a T2 version of T3 artillery. Very expensive, but can be serious threat for the enemy base, or an incoming army. A game ender on 5x5 1v1 maps and a major investment in teamgames. Faction diversity was also increased, where different factions have different artillery. 
			<li>TML: aoe increased for two reasons, the first is when attacking mexes with storage. The behavior is very inconsistent and can lead to not all storages destroyed, and in some cases even the mex survives! This is solved by increasing the aoe of the TML. The second reason is to make it a bit easier to snipe moving units with it, which makes the unit more interesting to use, and makes replays more fun as well! The amount of missiles TMLs can store has been decreased since you never need all 20 missiles, but they waste your mass if you forgot to turn autobuild off.
            <li>TMD: These have been changed so you can't groundfire them with TML like in the normal game!
			<li>The Aeon TMD has been (finally) fixed! Now it will catch missiles flying over it. It also got a reload time and duration change so it's not as easy to abuse 2 tmls to KO it. Because of this its had its mass cost adjusted.

			<li>T2 Flak: Increased the faction diversity of flak, not just pd. Muzzle velocity and aoe increased so flak is usable vs T3 air, so you can build them in combination with SAMs for a great air defense. Bigger cost as result of more expensive SAM and mobile flak. 
            <li>T3 Sam: cost increase which is so low because its only defence against T3 air. That is now not cause, because T2 flak can hit T3 air.

            <li>Shields in this game remain mostly the same, with a couple of nudges here and there to keep with the changed unit balance. A notable change is that the Cybran shield ED4 can now be built at T3, then upgraded once to the ED5 if needed.
            <li>Stealth: Seraphim personal cloak was added so that this building is fully invisible, except for a visual effect. This makes it easier to use offensively since the generator itself is harder to find. To prevent it from being used as a stealth intel system, its visual radius was reduced. It add more faction diversity to game.
            <li>T1/2 Radar: resource adjusted for building patter where units on same type and tech drain same resource while building.
            <li>T3 Radar: In most played map single omni sensor on back is enough to see whole map. This small change need move omni more in centre.
            <li>Perimeter: more hp, because its expensive T3 building witch in lot of cause then don't leave reclaim and its extremly easy to snipe.
            <li>Quantum optics: same place as on perimeter, more hp for same reason as on perimeter, buff action radius to safe multiple clicking to scout enemy base. Less initial energy to work with single storage and don't create "why its not working" situation.

                    <li>Emissary shows as a T4 unit, so you don’t confuse it with the Salvation

            <h4>Purpose:</h4>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Nuke + nuke defence: Build rate and missile build time changed for be able build defence with loaded missile on time when its nuke finished. It is more easy to assist nuke defence as nuke launcher, what make differences. 
            <li>T3 artillery: same price and same range for all, for avoid situation where aeon build artillery out of range as enemy artillery. More hp to alive single artillery shot for all faction. 
            <ul>
            <li>Salvation move as T3 artillery, for more faction diversity. Where its better against army, and less efficient against base.
            </ul>
            <li> The Novax was almost in the right place, it just needed a nudge to make it nicer to use - since its a spy satellite and the uef doesn't have an advanced intel structure (or rather this is it) it got a slight intel boost. And that abuse where you ctrl-k Novaxes to kill SMD, Mavors, arties, ect is fixed. 
            <li>Game ender: optimize resource and add more hp for alive single T3 artillery shot
            </ol>
